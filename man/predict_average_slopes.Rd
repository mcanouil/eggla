\arguments{
\item{fit}{A model object from a statistical model such as from a call to \code{nlme::lme()} and \code{time_model()}.}

\item{method}{The type of model provided in \code{fit}, \emph{i.e.}, one of \code{"cubic_slope"}, \code{"linear_splines"} or \code{"cubic_splines"}.}

\item{period}{The intervals knots on which slopes are to be computed.}

\item{knots}{The knots as defined \code{fit} and according to \code{method}.}
}
\value{
A \code{data.frame} with slopes for each individuals/samples.
}
\description{
