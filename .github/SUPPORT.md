# Getting help with `eggla`

Thanks for using `eggla`!
Before filing an issue, there are a few places to explore and pieces to put together to make the process as smooth as possible.

## Make a reprex

Start by making a minimal **repr**oducible **ex**ample using the  [reprex](https://reprex.tidyverse.org/) package.
If you haven't heard of or used reprex before, you're in for a treat!
Seriously, reprex will make all of your R-question-asking endeavors easier (which is a pretty insane ROI for the five to ten minutes it'll take you to learn what it's all about).
For additional reprex pointers, check out the [Get help!](https://www.tidyverse.org/help/) section of the tidyverse site.

## Where to ask?

Armed with your reprex, the next step is to figure out where to ask:

* If it's a question (or you are not sure if it's a bug): [open a Q&A discussion](https://github.com/mcanouil/eggla/discussions/new?category=q-a).

* If it's a bug: you're in the right place, [file an issue](https://github.com/mcanouil/eggla/issues/new).

Before opening a new issue, be sure to [search issues and pull requests](https://github.com/mcanouil/eggla/issues)
to make sure the bug hasn't been reported and/or already fixed in the development version.
By default, the search will be pre-populated with `is:issue is:open`.
You can [edit the qualifiers](https://help.github.com/articles/searching-issues-and-pull-requests/)  (_e.g._, `is:pr`, `is:closed`) as needed.
For example, you'd simply remove `is:open` to search _all_ issues in the repo, open or closed.
